     <p style="margin-left: 90px; color: #9BA8A7;">I have no idea how they have entered and sustained in the market.
       After my bitter experience, I started to investigate the reviews and understood their strategy
  They raise your expectation at first when registering on the site with a hiked price.
    After their inspection from IIT qualified engineers they deliver a report which is also fancy but a bit drowsy</p>

     <p style="margin-left: 90px; color: #9BA8A7;">Hello, MLG is a great website and is useful as it is sold as soon you want and
        I am sure that you will be satisfied with the price you sell your car.
        I have also sold a car of mine on MLG, it was almost sold within 4 days and the price was literally satisfying as my car model was quite old.
        I am sure and glad you like the website. In my opinion,MLG is best place for selling cars.</p>

     <p style="margin-left: 90px; color: #9BA8A7;">I bought my very first bike from MLG, and honestly I dont think it could have been any easier.
        Right from the start with the booking of the car to the test drive to the documentation process and finally to the RC transfer,
        I never felt like I was buying a second hand car. The condition of the car alone was way above my expectations.
         Didnt expect all of this to be this smooth and hassle free.
         I would definitely recommend them if you wish to buy or sell a car. Completely satisfied with the services.</p>

     <p style="margin-left: 90px; color: #9BA8A7;">I bought a Hyundai Elantra from MLG and within 4 months, it broke down having issues with the clutch.
       MLG refurb centre took about 2 months, and finally gave up saying they could not find parts.
     When I went ahead and got the repair done from an authorised service center, Cars24 tried to get out of their
     6 month warranty clause using technicalities and finally they said they could pay me less than half the amount that I had to spend for the repair.</p>
